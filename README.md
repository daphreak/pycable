# pycable
CAD for cables (in Python!)

Connectors, wires, and cables are the worst. Pycable is a side project I've started to help reduce my headaches related to designing and documenting low-level electrical system connectivity.

Nothing here is useful yet, and it may not be for a very long time.

The following priorities are roughly in order from high to low:

1. Data structures - Figure out what I want to capture and how.
2. Interoperability - Read and write existing file formats used for cabling. For examle NWF (Neutral Wire Format). 
3. Automation - Remove as much boilerplate/copy-pasta as possible from the process.
4. Tools - Engineer facing tools (yes eventually even GUIs) that implment an efficient workflow.
5. Education - Learn how others manage their designs and get feedback on how bad my Python is.
